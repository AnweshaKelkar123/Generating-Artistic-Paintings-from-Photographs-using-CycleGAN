It has been found that redrawing an image in a particular form of art
requires a well-trained artist and much time, and reasonably so.
However, AI now being capable of creativity beyond human
imagination, our project aims to transfer the painting style and features of an
artist to an image. This could help art enthusiasts visualise how some of their
photographs would look if painted by their favourite artists by emulating
renowned painters to recreate their images.
Thus, our goal is to turn photo-realistic images into synthetic artworks
without human intervention.
